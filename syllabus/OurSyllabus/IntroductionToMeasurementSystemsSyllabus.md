# Introduction to Measurement Systems

Instructor: Dennis Cazar Ramírez

Number of hours: 16 hours of classes over one month (~24 hours of total work)

Number of ECTS: 2 ECTS

## Course description

Present module is an introduction to the basic concepts needed to simulate and analyze signalconditioning circuits, develop skills in simulating and building simple circuits for data acquisition- 
The module is divided in 6 sessions (2 hours each) covering topics detailed below, each session isself-contained and includes a series of activities that can be performed independently either inthe lab or in remote.

### Topic overview

  * Fundamental of AC circuits
  * Sensors overview
  * Signal conditioning
  * Analog to Digital Conversion

## Pre-requisites

  * Basic programming knowledge: either C or C++ or Phyton.
  * Basic Analog Electronics: DC and AC Circuit Analysis 
  * Basic Digital Electronics: Binary system

## Schedule

The schedule is tentative and subject to change. The learning goals below should be viewed as the key concepts you should grasp after each session, and also as a study guide before each exam, and at the end of the course.

### Week 1: Basic Concepts
* Session 1
  * Review of AC circuit analysis
  * Measuring voltage, current and resistance
  * Errors in measurements
* Practice 1: 
  * RLC circuit characterization
  * Simulating the circuit
  * Prototyping
  * Testing
  
### Week 2: Sensors
* Session 2
  * Principal characteristics
  * Analog vs Digital sensors
  * Conditioning circuits
* Practice 2
  * Sensor characterization
  * Temperature: thermistor
  * Light intensity: photoresistor and LDR
  * Light detection: photodiode
  
 ### Week 3: Signal Conditioning
 * Session 3
   * Filtering, Lineralization
   * Amplification, attenuation
   * Operational Amplifiers (Opamps)
 * Practice 3
   * Measuring signals
   * Voltage and current
   * Resistance, capacitance, inductance
### Week 4: Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC)
* Session 4
  * ADC principles
  * Resolution
  * Input range
  * Sampling rate
* Practice 4: 
  * Data Acquisition
  * Simulating a Data Acquisition chain (DAQ)
  * Characterizing a DAQ
  * Measuring Light
  
## Class Structure
* Each session is a self-contained module
* A set of questions and exercises are proposed at the end of each session as individual work

## Assessments
* A report of simulations, measurements and calculations must be presented at the end of each practice
* A brief dissertation about the results of the practices is foreseen at the end of each section

## Lecture
* 4 lectures are scheduled every week during the course (4 sessions)
* The student must attend to at least 80% of the sessions programmed

## Practice
* Lab practices are scheduled during the course (4 sessions).
* The student will have access (on-site and/or remote) to the equipment needed to perform the practice.
* Attend and complete the activities programmed in practices is mandatory to approve the module.

# Grading
To approve this module the students must achieve 80% of total grade

## Grading Policy
The grade will count the assessments using the following proportions:
* 15% of your grade will be determined by solving a set of exercises (one per week).
* 30% of your grade will be determined by oral dissertations about the practices (one per week).
* 30% of your grade will be determined by quizzes (one per week).•25%of your grade will be determined by practice reports (one per week)
