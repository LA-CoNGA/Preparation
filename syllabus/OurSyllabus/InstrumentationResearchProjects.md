## Grading
To approve this module the students must present a scientific report and sustain an oral presentation of the results of his project.

### Grading Policy
The grade will count the assessments using the following proportions:
* 25% of your grade will be determined by the revision of the progress of the project
* 40% of your grade will be determined by oral dissertation about the results of the project
* 35% of your grade will be determined by a revision of a written article

## Proposed projects
This is a list of possible projects to be carried on. The student along with the tutor can propose and develop any other theme not listed but inside the topics list


#### Nuclear Immaging (PET)

* Description: 
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanner is the state-of-the-art medical imaging system, capable of providing detailed functional information of physiological processes inside the human body. PET represents a beautiful example of integration of skills and competences from medicine, nuclear chemistry, physics and information technology.

* Topics
  * γ Spectroscopy and System Linearity
  * Positron Annihilation Detection
  * Two-dimensional Reconstruction of a Radioactive Source
  * Spatial Resolution

* Material/Equipment
  * CAEN SP5701-Easy PET Kit
  * Radioactive source (22Na 1/2 inch disk, 10uCi)
  
* Institutions and responsable
  * UNI
  * UAN
  * UIS
  * UCV
  * USB

#### Particle Detection: Muon bundles

* Description: 
Cosmic ray physics is our unique source of information on events in the energy range which will never be accessible in Earth-bound experiments. This is why one of the most important aspects of their investigation is the understanding of the primary cosmic ray (CR) flux and its composition. A number of events with muon bundles of high multiplicity was registered in the Extensive Air Showers (EAS) produced by cosmic ray interactions in the upper atmosphere. A special emphasis has been given to the study of high multiplicity events containing more than 100 reconstructed muons. Similar events have already been studied in the previous LEP experiments at CERN.To describe them existe the idea that muon bundles of extremely high multiplicities could be produced by strangelets, hypothetical stable lumps of strange quark matter (SQM) infiltrating our Universe

#### Particle Detection: Measurement of Muon lifetime

* Description: 
The average lifetime of the muon has a well known value. It can be obtained for the average lifetime of a muon by detecting the rate at which muons from cosmic rays decay inside a detector (plastic scintillator, WCD).
