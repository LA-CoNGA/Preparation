Number of ECTS: 5 ECTS

Number of hours: 140 hours of total work.
* 32 hours of classes (4 hrs per week for 8 weeks)
* 16 hours of tutorials (2 hrs per week for 8 weeks)

## Course description
The aim of this course is to provide a general overview of the most used techniques of field theory in statistical physics and to understand the most relevant mechanism entering in the phenomena of phase transition, phases classification, and critical phenomena. 

### Topic overview

* Phase transitions in lattice systems
* From the Ising model in the lattice to a field theory in the continuum
* The gaussian model
* Broken symmetries and Goldstone modes
* The renormalization group and universality classes
* The XY model and topological defects
* Other examples in statistical mechanics

## Schedule

### Class Structure
* Each session is a self-contained module
* A set of questions, videos, exercises and reading are proposed at the end of each session for individual work

### Assessments
Students are expected to submit 4 written homeworks. This corresponds to 100% of the total grade.
