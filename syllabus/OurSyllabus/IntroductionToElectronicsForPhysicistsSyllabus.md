# Introduction to Electronics for Physicists

Instructor:

Number of hours: 16 hours of classes over one month (~24 hours of total work) (Reina: too much!?!)

Number of ECTS: 1 ECTS

## Course description

Electronics for Physicists covers the fundamental knowledge needed to understand how a data acquisition system works. The main objective is to train the student in analyzing and simulating electronic circuits, understand the characteristics of AD and DA converters and introduce the basic techniques for programming data acquisition systems, data acquisition and visualization.
The course is divided in 8 sessions (2 hours each) covering topics detailed below.  Each session is self-contained and includes a series of activities that can be performed independently either in the lab or in remote. 

### Topic overview

  * Fundamental of Data Acquisition Systems (DAQ)
  * DAQ hardware & software
  * Communication bus
  * Digital to Analog (DACs) and Analog to Digital converters (ADCs)
  * Digital Signal Processing (DSP)
  * Design of Data Acquisition Systems

## Pre-requisites

  * Basic programming knowledge: either C or C++ or Phyton.
  * Basic Analog Electronics: DC and AC Circuit Analysis 
  * Basic Digital Electronics: Binary system
