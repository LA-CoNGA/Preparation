# Detector Physics

Instructor:

Number of hours: 16 hours of classes over one month (~24 hours of total work)

Number of ECTS: 1 ECTS

## Course description
The aim of this course is learn the principles of particle detection, as well as to get an overview on the most used detectors used nowdays. The course will be divided even further, such that each kind of detector will be covered by a different teacher. Lectures should include as many exercises as posible and lecturers are encourage to invite people for short seminar about state-of-the-art detection techniques when possible.

### Topic overview

* Historic of particle detection
* Particle-matter interactions
* Solid state detector: 
** Scintillators and photodetectors
** Semi-conductor based detectors
* Gaseous detectors
* Calorimetry: electromagnetic and hadronic calorimetry
* Particle identification in nuclear and high energy physics
* From detectors to data: trigger, simulation, reconstruction/calibration, a glance of data analysis
