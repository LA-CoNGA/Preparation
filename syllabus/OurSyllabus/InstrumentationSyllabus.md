# Instrumentation

Instructor: To be Defined

Number of hours: 32 hours of classes over two months (~64 hours of total work)

Number of ECTS: 3 ECTS

## Course description
In the areas of science and engineering it is of vital importance to carry out measurements of different kinds either to prove theories about natural phenomena or to explore new areas of knowledge. This course is an introduction to scientific instrumentation focused in two main topics: particle and radiation detection and complex systems.
	
The approach of this course is "hands-on" oriented, after a concise introduction of topics the student may dig into the concepts while performing experiments, gathering data analyzing an reporting results. Discussion of the results of the experiments is an important part of the course 

The course is divided in 10 sessions covering topics detailed below and 7 practices where the student will be trained in the use of scientific instrumentation for particle and radiation detectors and exploring complex systems 

### Topic overview

* Historic of particle detection
* Particle-matter interactions
* Solid state detector: 
  * Scintillators and photodetectors

* The student must attend to at least 80% of the sessions programmed
### Practice
* Lab practices are scheduled during the course (7 sessions).
* The student will have access (on-site and/or remote) to the equipment needed to performthe practice.•Attend and complete the activities programmed in practices is mandatory to approve themodule

## Grading
To approve this module the students must achieve 80% of total grade

### Grading Policy
The grade will count the assessments using the following proportions:
* 15% of your grade will be determined by solving a set of exercises (one per week).
* 30% of your grade will be determined by oral dissertations about the practices or theoreticaltopics (one per week).
* 30% of your grade will be determined by quizzes (one per week).
* 25%of your grade will be determined by practice reports (7 reports)
