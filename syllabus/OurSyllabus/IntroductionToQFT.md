# Introduction to Quantum Field Theory

Instructor(s): To be defined

Number of ECTS: 5 ECTS

Number of hours: 140 hours of total work.
* 32 hours of classes (4 hrs per week for 8 weeks)
* 16 hours of tutorials (2 hrs per week for 8 weeks)
* 32 hours of written assignments (8 homeworks of 4 hrs each)

## Course description
The aim of this course is to learn the basic formalism of Quantum Field Theory and its applications in Particle Physics and Condensed Matter. 
This course is commong to both specialisation: complex Systems and High Energy Physics.

### Topic overview
* Special relativity
* Classical field theory
* Free scalar fields
* Interacting scalar fields
* Feynman calculus
* Renormalization
* Spontaneous symmetry breaking

### Pre-requisites/Co-requisites
* Classical Mechanics
* Electromagnetism
* Quantum Mechanics

Remedial tutorials will be offered to students who are not Physics majors. 

## Schedule

### Class Structure
* Each session is a self-contained module
* A set of questions, videos, exercises and reading are proposed at the end of each session for individual work

### Assessments
Students are expected to submit 8 written homeworks. This corresponds to 100% of the total grade.
