# Module for student projects

Instructor:

Number of hours: 24 h (6 weeks)

Number of ECTS: 2

## Course description

Two hands on excesices based on datasets provided by the instructors from the Stats and RSE courses.

* One exercise will be based in HEP open data (3 weeks)
* Another exercise in a dataset coming from industry (3 weeks)

All students will do both exercises. There can be cases of one larger project taking all the 6 weeks. 

### Topic overview

#### LHC experimental data: CMS, ATLAS, LHCb open data
#### Other experimental data: LAGO
#### Kaggle challenges
#### Industry datasets

### Proposed projects

1. Project title: ‘AI Commons’: A framework for collaboration to achieve global impact

Duration: 3 weeks

Dataset: Need to contact the community to get the datasets. These are datasets released in collaboration with the UN.

Objectives: A common knowledge hub to accelerate the world’s challenges with Artificial Intelligence

Comments: it might be better to use these datasets for the AI course in the second semester. Here is the link: https://ai-commons.org


2. Project title: New York City Airbnb Open Data

Duration: 3 weeks

Dataset: kaggle challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data)

Objectives: This data file includes all needed information to find out more about hosts, geographical availability, necessary metrics to make predictions and draw conclusions. 

Comments: There is also the possiblity of having some data criminality statistics for the city of London. 


3. Project title: Scientific computing: design and deploy of physics data analysis pipelines with in-house and cloud computing.

Duration: 3 months or 6 months (the complexity can be calibrated)

Dataset: LHC experiments Open Data at 8 and 13 TeV 

Objectives: 
* With the development of a physics analysis (HEP for example)
    * Train the student to design data analysis in terms of the resources, the procedures, versioning and maintainability.
    * Develop a culture of reproducibility and proper analysis development protocols.
    * Get into the so-called "Big Data" by prototyping analysis using Open Data.
    * Present the final products in a modern way, under the proper licensing and DOI identification.
