Instructor:

Number of hours: 70 hours of classes over 7 weeks, 10 hours of programing examples (125 total work hours)

Number of ECTS: 5 

## Course description
A pedagogical selection of topics in probability and statistics is presented.
Choice and emphasis are driven predominantly
from physics analyses using experimental data from high-energy physics detectors. The final section gives a high level description of basic concepts on machine learning. 
The magistral classes are completed with practical training sessions.

### Topic overview

- Basic concepts in probability and statistics
- Parametric PDFs and parameter estimation 
- The maximum likelihood theorem and its applications
- Statistical hypothesis testing
- Basic concepts in Machine Learning 


## Pre-requisites

Open and mandatory to all LA-CoNGA students
