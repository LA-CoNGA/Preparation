Number of ECTS: 5 

Number of hours: 125 total work hours

- 28 hours of classes/tutorials over 7 weeks. 
- 12 hours of programing or practical exercises over 6 weeks.

## Course description
A pedagogical selection of topics in probability and statistics is presented.
Choice and emphasis are driven predominantly from physics analyses using experimental data from high-energy physics detectors. The final section gives a high level description of basic concepts on machine learning. 
The magistral classes are completed with practical training sessions.

### Topic overview

- Basic concepts in probability and statistics
- Parametric PDFs and parameter estimation 
- The maximum likelihood theorem and its applications
- Statistical hypothesis testing
- Basic concepts in Machine Learning 

## Pre-requisites/co-requisites

Open and mandatory to all LA-CoNGA students.
Students must have followed the Research Software Engineering course.

## Schedule

### Class Structure
* Each session is a self-contained module
* The magistral classes are completed with practical training sessions using jupyter notebooks

### Assessments
The assessment of this module is based on:
