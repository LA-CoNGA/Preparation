# Title Probability and Statistics

Instructor:

Number of hours: 24 hours of classes over one month, 16 hours of training

Number of ECTS: to be defined

## Course description
A pedagogical selection of topics in probability and statistics is presented.
Choice and emphasis are driven predominantly
from physics analyses using experimental data from high-energy physics detectors. The final section gives a high level description of basic concepts on machine learning. 
The magistral classes are completed with practical training sessions.

### Topic overview
