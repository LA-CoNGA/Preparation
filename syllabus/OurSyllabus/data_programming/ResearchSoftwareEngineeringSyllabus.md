# Research Software Engineering in Python

Instructor(s): To be defined

Number of ECTS: 2 ECTS

Number of hours: 50 hours of total work.

- 24 hours of classes/tutorials over 5 weeks. 
- 6 hours of self guided exercises.
- 20 hours of evaluation work. 

## Course description
The aim of this course is learn how to construct reliable, readable, efficient research software in a collaborative environment. 
The course is based on Python but the general ideas can be applied to any other programming language.

### Topic overview

* Introduction to software engineering for reproducible research
* Python basics
* Research Data in Python
* Version Control
* Testing your code
* Building software projects
* Reproducible environments
* Construction and design practices
* Speed and optimisation
* Advanced Programming Techniques

## Pre-requisites/Co-requisites

Basic programming knowledge. Students should have done an introductory course in Python, we will provide a recommended online course. 

## Schedule

### Class Structure
* Each session is a self-contained module
* A set of questions and exercises are proposed at the end of each session as individual work
### Assessments
The assessment of this module is based on a code assignment.   
Students are expected to submit a short report and your code. The purpose of the report is to answer the non-coding questions, to present results and provide a brief description of design choices and implementation. 
This correspond to 20% of the total grade for the data science module.
