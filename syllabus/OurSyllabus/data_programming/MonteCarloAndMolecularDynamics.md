## Course description
The aims of this course are:
* To understand the basic concepts of numerical simulations
* To study the main algorithms for Monte Carlo and molecular Dynamics, and how to extract data corresponding to relevant observables
* To elaborate a project for a simulation of system either in statical physical or in a more general context of complex systems

## Pre-requisites/Co-requisites

Pre-requisites: Basic knowledge ion statistical physics and programming. 
Co-requisites: The mandatory courses of the complex system branch

## Schedule

### Class Structure
* 3 weeks for the theoretical course on Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics techniques 
* 3 weeks for the simulation project

### Assessments
The assessment of this module will be done in two parts: a brief dissertation about an application of the MC and MD methods at the end of the theoretical course, and a report and a presentation of the simulation project results. 
This correspond to 30% of the total grade for the data science module.

## Schedule and weekly learning goals

### Week 1-3: theoretical background

* Introduction to the Monte Carlo method
  * Sampling from ensembles, thermodynamics averages, fluctuations, time correlation functions
